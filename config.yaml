    title: "About Me"
    image: "Sarmakeeva.png"
    content: |-
            I graduated from George Washington University with a Ph.D. in Computational Fluid Dynamics, focusing on reproducible research. I have a strong background in applied mathematics and computer science, which equipped me well for the challenges of my graduate research. In my free time, I explore quantitative finance, Web3 technologies, contemporary art, running, and yoga. Currently based in Washington, DC, I am open to relocation."
