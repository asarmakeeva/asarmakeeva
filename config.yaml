    content: |-
            I am a graduate student at George Washington University, pursuing my Ph.D. in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamic with focus on reproducible research. I have a strong background in applied math and computer science, which have prepared me well for the challenges of my graduate research project. In my free time, I have a keen interest in quantitative finance, web3 technologies, and contemporary art. I am currently based in Washington, DC. 

            My research on simulating water flooding with solid body rotation and two-phase fluid. I am excited to see where my studies and interests will take me in the future.
